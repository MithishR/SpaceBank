# SpaceBank - Spaceship resource management.

Welcome to SpaceBank, a project developed to fulfill the needs of humanity as we navigate a crisis, forcing us to relocate to space stations for our survival. There are seven space stations, each representing a continent on Earth. To aid our survival, SpaceBank is a highly interactive and UI-friendly resource management software. It provides services to users, helping them efficiently manage their daily needs and interactions within the limited confines of a space station.

## Mission
SpaceBank is a highly interactive software which allocates necessary resources such as food, water, oxygen and energy in each space station efficiently. The software also allows users to get necessary services in the space station, ensuring that individuals on the space stations can maintain a comfortable and healthy lifestyle by overseeing their daily needs and interactions with spaceship facilities.

## Features
### Resource Monitoring
Real-time tracking of spaceship resources such as food, water, oxygen, and energy to calculate the survival time of the space station, ensuring that residents can make informed decisions regarding resource consumption.
